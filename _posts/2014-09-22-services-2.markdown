NPO's and citizen action groups need a way to crowdsource innovation projects. Crowdfunding is a good alternative financing model, but often dominated by tech projects offering rewards.   W4P is an Open Crowdsourcing platform designed to host single innovation projects that are searching for funding (donations or rewards based), volunteers, coaching or materials. I'm the project and business lead.
