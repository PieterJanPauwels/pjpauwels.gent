As part of being an independent NPO we host commercially funded events that promote open data use and open source. Open Belgium is a community-driven conference gathering stakeholders from government, research, industries and the community itself. open Summer of code on the other hand is a four week Open Source innovation camp for students with a technical, communication of business background. I've been the lead organiser of three Open Belgium editions and two #oSoc editions.
